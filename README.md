This website is a clone of change.org, made for the final project of The Odin Project's front-end javascript course. The site features responsive design and is functional.

Built from scratch with React + Redux, Tailwind and Firebase, and bootstrapped with create-react-app. Site can be accessed at https://nyoos.github.io/change-clone/.
